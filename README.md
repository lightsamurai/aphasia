Clustering aphasic patients' linguistic production by computational means (Word2vec)

We compute the semantic distance between a target word - according the tasks of the Aphasia Bank Protocol https://aphasia.talkbank.org/ - and the response word of aphasic patients in accomplishing the task. Our aim is to computationalize the severeness of the aphasic symptoms in linguistic production, considering the semantic accuracy of the response.
